# ta-lib-aws-lambda
Python 3.6 TA-Lib for AWS Lamba

It took me a while to get this sorted so I thought I would share

1) Put the contents into a zip (not the folder the actual contents)
2) Create Lambda function
3) Upload
4) Pass the Hello World test function and TA-Lib will output all functions

Enjoy
